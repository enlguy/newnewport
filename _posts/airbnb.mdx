Airbnb is already slammed on the daily for its piss poor customer support, with an entire website called Airbnbhell.com boasting tens of thousands of horrific stories from using the platform for booking accommodation. Reddit and Facebook also have hundreds of posts daily about bad experiences with support staff, most citing a lack of understanding of English being a major problem resulting in bungled support cases that cost Airbnb customers an extra 50% over what they have agreed to pay. Doubling down on incompetency in support, Airbnb simply sees apes as the next step in building the world's worst support staff.  

Some asked whether or not the monkeys would be compensated, to which Cheskey replied, "All the bananas they can eat." He then added after a pause, "Well.. maybe two per day, we're not made of money." The company's latest valuation sits at about $80 billion. Our undercover team also found this office at Airbnb headquarters:
